# Sprouting a STEM Community (SSC) 2024
## Statistics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

The lesson covers the basics of statistics and teaches students how to work with data sets. It includes discussions on probability distributions, random variables, and distributions. It also teaches students different ways to group data and how to compare two sets of data. The lesson includes a practical exercise where students work through a Google Colab Notebook to visualize normal distributions and cumulative distribution functions. Finally, the lesson covers statistical tests for comparing distributions and how to evaluate the significance of the difference in means of two distributions using the t-test code.
