# Model Training and Validation with California Census Data

## Lesson Guide

By the end of this lesson, you will understand the importance of splitting data into training and test sets to prevent overfitting and evaluate your model's ability to generalize. You will also learn how different loss functions and regularization techniques can improve model performance by balancing prediction accuracy and complexity.

**Explore and Understand the California Housing Dataset**

Our dataset is from `sklearn`. Most datasets obtained from `sklearn` have a `.DESCR` attribute, which provides a description of the dataset.

**Instantiate a Linear Regression Class and Fit a Linear Model**

Reference the documentation of the `LinearRegression` class from `sklearn` to figure out how to instantiate a linear regression class and then fit a model. Navigate to the examples portion of the documentation.
